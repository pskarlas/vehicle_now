# Task “The Frontend”

### Requirements
Imagine you want to build a small frontend to show available vehicles which can be rented
out now. \
There is an API available (on one of our test systems) which exposes all required data.\
Your task is to build a UI which consumes the given API and shows available vehicles.\
Please:
- Pick any technology and framework you like
- It's only required to show vehicles, you therefore can ignore other endpoints (like
actually renting out a vehicle)
-  You can choose any representation/UI (but be ready to explain why you used it)
- It not important to have it "fancy" or "beautiful" - focus on being maintainable and
usable
- Optional: let the user select the "from" and "until" date
